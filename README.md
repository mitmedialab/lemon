# LEMON: Learning Innovators - Middle East

Learning Innovators Middle East is a capacity-building program developed by the [MIT Media Lab Learning Initiative](http://learn.media.mit.edu/). The innovation accelerator will train and enable a cohort of learning technology developers in the Middle East to develop education solutions for refugees.

The project will work with bright young people from the Middle East region, who already have some tech proficiency and an interest in further developing these skills. They will be offered online courses on digital pedagogy, and refugee education; the program incorporates project-based learning, mentorship and an emphasis on peer-to-peer learning.

This is the frontend submodule of LIME. Checkout [the main repo](https://github.com/ml-learning/lime).
